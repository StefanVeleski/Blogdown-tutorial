```

# R Markdown AAAAAAAAAAAAA

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
fit
```

# Including Plots

You can also embed plots. See Figure \@ref(fig:pie) for example:

```{r pie, fig.cap='A fancy pie chart.', tidy=FALSE}
par(mar = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
pie(
  c(280, 60, 20),
  c('Sky', 'Sunny side of pyramid', 'Shady side of pyramid'),
  col = c('#0292D8', '#F7EA39', '#C4B632'),
  init.angle = -50, border = NA
)
```

# Including a Shiny app in R markdown

There are two things that you will need to do:

1. Insert the phrase "runtime: shiny" in the YAML header
2. Add a code chunk with the following code: (add echo = FALSE to the chunk options in the curled brackets if you'd prefer not to print the code)

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_app("https://stefanveleski.shinyapps.io/popularity/", height = "550px")
```
