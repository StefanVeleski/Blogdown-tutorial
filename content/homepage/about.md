## Self Introduction

This course aims to introduce students to the R programming language. The course is intended to give students a gentle push towards the path of programming, which may either take them towards a more data driven approach in their MA studies, or towards careers that mix insight from the humanities and programming and/or data analysis, such as technical writing. By the end of the course, the students will be acquainted with the fundamentals of R, version control with Github, the basics of computational analysis of text, R Markdown as a markup language, and how to create a website in R Studio with the "blogdown" package. Moreover, the students will begin to think about the application of quantitative approaches to the study of literature and will acquire the necessary knowledge to continue independent work and further develop their programming skills according to their academic or professional needs.
